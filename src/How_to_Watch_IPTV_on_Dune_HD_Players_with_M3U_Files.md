Dune HD is a family of high-end media players that can play various video and audio formats, as well as online content. Dune HD players have a limited support for IPTV channels playback, but you can use this feature if your internet provider provides IPTV channels matching the following specifications:
 
- Non-encrypted channels (free access).
- Multicast UDP (raw UDP) or multicast RTP (RTP-over-UDP) protocols.
- MPEG2-TS container.
- MPEG2 or H.264 video codec (any video resolution from SD PAL/NTSC to FullHD 1080p).

Consult with your internet provider to check if such IPTV channels are available. In this article, we will show you how to watch IPTV on Dune HD players with M3U files.
 
## What are M3U files?
 
M3U files are text files that contain a list of links to IPTV channels. Each link has a format of udp://@ip-address:port, which is the same syntax as used in VLC PC application. You can create your own M3U files with any text editor, or download them from your IPTV provider or other sources on the internet.
 
## How to use M3U files on Dune HD players?
 
There are two approaches to use M3U files on Dune HD players:

1. Approach A: Use M3U files directly. You can copy one or several M3U files to a USB flash drive or a network folder, and launch them in the file browser of the Dune HD player. Use the PLAY remote button to launch the playback of IPTV channels in the file browser (when a folder contains links to multiple IPTV channels). Then use the MENU remote button to switch between IPTV channels.
2. Approach B: Use nice-looking menus with logo icons for each IPTV channel. You can download a ZIP archive with an IPTV configuration (IPTV\_config\_xxx.zip) from [Dune Firmware Zone / IPTV](https://dune-hd.com/support/iptv/) [^1^] [^2^], or create your own configuration using the so called "dune\_folder" mechanism (more details). To use a particular IPTV configuration as the IPTV menu in the main screen, do the following:
    - Ensure that "SETUP / Applications / IPTV / Show in main screen" setting is set to "Yes".
    - If you use Dune HD Ultra or Dune HD Mini player: ensure that "IPTV\_config" folder exists at the top level of the "primary" drive attached to the player ("primary" drive is: internal HDD if it is installed; first recognized USB drive if internal HDD is not installed). If the "IPTV\_config" folder does not exist, create it, e.g. using the regular "create folder" function of the file browser. After that, "IPTV" item will be shown in the main screen. NOTE: This step is not needed if you use Dune BD Prime or Dune HD Center player.
    - Using a PC, extract "IPTV\_config" folder from the ZIP archive into some storage media (e.g. onto USB flash drive, or via network to some network folder). Then copy this folder into "IPTV\_config" folder on your primary drive attached to your Dune HD player.

## How to record IPTV channels on Dune HD players?
 
You can also record IPTV channels on Dune HD players. Use the PLAY remote button to start/stop recording of the IPTV channel during playback. Each recording session is saved as a separate .TS file in the "IPTV\_recordings" folder in the
