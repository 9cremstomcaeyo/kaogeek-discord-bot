## What Is The Book Work Study And Ergonomics About?
  
The book **Work Study And Ergonomics** is a comprehensive textbook that covers the principles and practices of work study and ergonomics for students, researchers, and practitioners of industrial engineering, management, human factors, occupational health, and related fields. The book is divided into four parts:
  
- Part I: Introduction to Work Study and Ergonomics. This part provides an overview of the history, scope, objectives, methods, and applications of work study and ergonomics. It also introduces the concepts of human factors engineering, human-machine system, human information processing, human error, workload, stress, fatigue, motivation, and job satisfaction.
- Part II: Work Study. This part covers the techniques of work measurement, work simplification, method study, motion study, time study, standard time determination, work sampling, predetermined motion time systems (PMTS), learning curves, incentive schemes, productivity improvement programs, and lean manufacturing.
- Part III: Ergonomics. This part covers the topics of anthropometry, biomechanics, environmental factors (noise, vibration, lighting, temperature), workstation design (layout, posture, seating), manual material handling (lifting, carrying), hand tools design (grip force, torque), display design (visual acuity

    , color, contrast), control design (shape, size, location, feedback), keyboard design (layout, key size, key force), computer workstation design (monitor, mouse, keyboard, software), and ergonomics in office work.

    Part IV: Special Topics. This part covers the special topics of ergonomics in industrial automation, robotics, virtual reality, teleoperation, human-computer interaction, ergonomics in health care, ergonomics in sports and leisure activities, ergonomics in transportation (road, rail, air, sea), and ergonomics in disaster management.
